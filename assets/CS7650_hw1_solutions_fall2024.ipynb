    "In this assignment, you will be implementing different deep learning models for text classification using the [20 Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/). It is esentially classifying news articles into different topics. This assignment will start with with data preprocessing techniques, implementing a baseline, and building up from there to more advanced model. It will cover basics of attention mechanism, something very central to modern NLP systems, and present you an opportunity to analyse different aspects of your training model.\n",

    "Let's move to modeling, now that we have dataset iterators that batch our data for us. The first model is a simple model called NBOW-RAND.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code block, you'll build a feed-forward neural network implementing a neural bag-of-words baseline, NBOW-RAND, described in section 2.1 of [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1162.pdf). You'll find [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) page useful for understanding the different layers and [this](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html) page useful for how to put them into action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind this baseline is that after we embed each word for a document, we average the embeddings to produce a single vector that hopefully captures some general information spread across the sequence of embeddings. This means we first turn each document of length *n* into a matrix of *nxd*, where *d* is the dimension of the embedding. Then we average this matrix to produce a vector of length *d*, summarizing the contents of the document and proceed with the rest of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you're working through this implementation, keep in mind how the dimensions change and what each axes represents, as documents will be passed in as minibatches requiring careful selection of which axes you apply certain operations too. Stick to only the architecture described in the instructions below, do not add additional layers, this will impact the validity of local checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the following equation on how to define NBOW -\n",

    "$$ p(y|x) = softmax(w^T h_{avg}) $$\n",

    "*HINT*: In the forward step, the BATCH_SIZE is the first dimension.\n",

    "Self-attention is a mechanism in neural networks that enables each element in a sequence to consider and weigh the importance of every other element. This facilitates a more nuanced and context-aware representation of the sequence, greatly enhancing the capabilities of models in tasks involving sequential data, particularly in NLP. It has gained prominence with the introduction and success of Transformer models, like BERT, GPT (including GPT-3), and others. This is not a full-fledged implementation of it, but instead a conceptual flavor of the mechanism."
