    "# Introduction to PyTorch with NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a popular open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab that provides flexibility and dynamic computational graphs, making it highly favored for research and production purposes. With its intuitive interface, PyTorch allows developers to build and train complex neural networks with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computation graph is a network of nodes where each node represents an operation or variable, and the edges represent data dependencies between operations. Dynamic computation graphs are particularly useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where the input data, such as sentences or sequences, can vary in length and structure. PyTorch’s dynamic nature allows the graph to adapt to different input shapes and sizes, making it easier to handle complex tasks like sequence-to-sequence learning, attention mechanisms, and more.\n",

    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the location of tensors—whether on a CPU or GPU—directly impacts the performance and functionality of your code. Tensors can be stored on different devices, and operations on tensors must be performed on the same device to avoid errors and inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Performance Optimization: Moving tensors to the GPU can significantly accelerate computations, as GPUs are designed to handle matrix operations much more efficiently than CPUs. This is especially important for training deep learning models where large amounts of data and complex operations are involved.\n",
    "2. Error Prevention: PyTorch requires all tensors involved in a computation to be on the same device. If operations are attempted between tensors on different devices (e.g., adding a CPU tensor to a GPU tensor), it will result in a runtime error like RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cpu!. Properly managing tensor locations ensures compatibility and prevents such errors.\n",
    "3. Memory Management: GPUs have limited memory compared to CPUs. Properly managing tensor locations helps efficiently utilize GPU memory and avoid issues like out-of-memory errors. Moving tensors to the appropriate device only when needed can help balance memory usage across devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a code snippet explaining critical aspects of tensor location management in PyTorch, highlighting performance benefits and common pitfalls."

    "### 2.3. One-Hot Encoding: processing the categorical labels\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding is a common technique used to convert categorical data into a numerical format for machine learning algorithms. Unlike label encoding, which assigns an integer to each category, one-hot encoding converts categorical variables into a binary matrix representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is One-Hot Encoding?\n",
    "\n",
    "In one-hot encoding, each category is represented by a binary vector. The vector has the same length as the number of unique categories, with a `1` in the position corresponding to the category and `0` in all other positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding represents these sentiments as follows (for example):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{{\"empty\"}} &\\rightarrow [1, 0, 0, 0] \\\\\n",
    "\\text{{\"sadness\"}} &\\rightarrow [0, 1, 0, 0] \\\\\n",
    "\\text{{\"enthusiasm\"}} &\\rightarrow [0, 0, 1, 0] \\\\\n",
    "\\text{{\"neutral\"}} &\\rightarrow [0, 0, 0, 1] \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\( x \\) is a categorical feature with \\( n \\) unique values, one-hot encoding can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{{OHE}}(x_i) = [b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b_j =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if } x_i \\text{ belongs to category } j \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removes any assumption of ordinal relationships between categories, unlike label encoding.\n",
    "- Works well with algorithms that require input to be in a binary format (e.g., neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increases the dimensionality of the dataset, which can lead to a large number of features if there are many unique categories.\n",
    "- Sparse representation can increase memory usage and computational complexity.\n"

    "\n",
    "The train-test split is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preventing Overfitting**: By keeping the test set separate from the training data, we can detect if the model is overfitting—i.e., performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",

    "### 2.6. Vocabulary Map\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Vocabulary Class** is a fundamental component in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is responsible for mapping words or tokens in a dataset to unique numerical identifiers (indices). This mapping allows the conversion of text data into numerical format, which is essential for feeding it into machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Vocabulary Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Vocabulary Class manages the collection of unique tokens (words, subwords, or characters) in a dataset and assigns each token a unique index. The vocabulary typically includes special tokens that serve specific purposes, such as indicating the start or end of a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic functionalities of a Vocabulary Class include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Token-to-Index Mapping**: Converting each token to a unique index.\n",
    "- **Index-to-Token Mapping**: Converting indices back to tokens (useful for decoding model outputs).\n",
    "- **Managing Special Tokens**: Handling tokens like padding, unknown words, start-of-sequence, and end-of-sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of a Vocabulary Class\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Token-to-Index Mapping**:\n",
    "   - The main functionality of the vocabulary is to map each unique token in the dataset to a unique integer index. For instance, if your dataset contains the tokens `[\"I\", \"love\", \"NLP\"]`, the vocabulary might map them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "     | Token | Index |\n",
    "     |-------|-------|\n",
    "     | I     | 1     |\n",
    "     | love  | 2     |\n",
    "     | NLP   | 3     |\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Index-to-Token Mapping**:\n",
    "   - This is the inverse operation, which allows converting indices back to their respective tokens. This is useful during the model inference phase to convert model predictions back into human-readable text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Special Tokens**:\n",
    "   - **\\<PAD\\>**: Used for padding sequences to the same length within a batch. This ensures that all sequences in a batch are of uniform length, making them suitable for batch processing.\n",
    "   - **\\<UNK\\>**: Represents unknown tokens, i.e., tokens that were not in the training vocabulary. This is essential for handling out-of-vocabulary words during inference.\n",
    "   - **<SOS\\>**: Indicates the start of a sequence. This is commonly used in sequence generation tasks like machine translation or text generation.\n",
    "   - **\\<EOS\\>**: Marks the end of a sequence. It helps models know when to stop generating further tokens.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Are Special Tokens Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Special tokens play a critical role in text preprocessing and model training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Padding (<PAD>)**: When batching sequences of varying lengths, shorter sequences are padded with `<PAD>` tokens to ensure all sequences in a batch have the same length. This padding is essential for efficient batch processing in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unknown Token (<UNK>)**: During inference, the model may encounter words that were not seen during training. The `<UNK>` token helps the model handle these situations gracefully, rather than crashing or producing undefined behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start-of-Sequence (<SOS>) and End-of-Sequence (<EOS>)**: In tasks like sequence-to-sequence modeling, it’s important for the model to know when a sequence starts and ends. `<SOS>` and `<EOS>` tokens guide the model during generation and ensure coherent outputs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Dos:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include Special Tokens: Always include special tokens in your vocabulary, especially if your task involves sequence generation or varying sequence lengths.\n",
    "- Handle Out-of-Vocabulary Words: Ensure your vocabulary can handle out-of-vocabulary words by including an <UNK> token, which prevents the model from encountering undefined behavior during inference.\n",
    "- Only make the vocabulary using the training set: In real-world, you don't have test data. So, to adequately represent that, construct your vocabulary using only training set.\n"

    "### 2.7. Understanding `max_len`, Padding, and Truncation in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with sequential data, such as text, it's common to encounter sequences of varying lengths. In NLP, these sequences might represent sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents, and their lengths can vary significantly. However, most machine learning models, especially those based on deep learning, require input sequences to be of uniform length. This is where concepts like `max_len`, padding, and truncation become essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is `max_len`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`max_len` is a parameter that defines the maximum length of the sequences that will be fed into the model. Any sequence longer than `max_len` will be truncated, and any sequence shorter than `max_len` will be padded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Why is `max_len` Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniform Input Size**: Deep learning models networks require input sequences to be of the same length. `max_len` ensures that all sequences in a batch have the same length, allowing for efficient batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Setting an appropriate `max_len` helps in managing memory usage. Sequences that are too long might lead to excessive memory consumption, especially in models like Transformers, where memory usage scales with the square of the sequence length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Efficiency**: By limiting the sequence length with `max_len`, you ensure that your model processes only the most relevant parts of the sequence, improving training efficiency and potentially leading to faster convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding** is the process of adding a special token (usually `<PAD>`) to sequences to ensure they reach the specified `max_len`. Padding is typically added to the end of the sequence, but it can also be added at the beginning in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Padding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Processing**: In machine learning, it’s common to process data in batches for efficiency. However, when dealing with sequences of varying lengths, directly batching them is not possible. Padding allows all sequences to be of the same length, enabling efficient batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Information Loss**: Padding ensures that no information from shorter sequences is lost, as it only adds neutral tokens that do not contribute to the model’s learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original sequences:\n",
    "[\"I love NLP\", \"Deep learning is fun\", \"AI is the future\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "After padding (assuming max_len=5):\n",
    "[\"I love NLP <PAD> <PAD>\", \"Deep learning is fun <PAD>\", \"AI is the future <PAD> <PAD>\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Truncation\n",
    "Truncation is the process of cutting off sequences that are longer than the specified max_len. This is done to ensure that no sequence exceeds the maximum length, which is crucial for maintaining uniformity in input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Truncation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Long Sequences: In many NLP tasks, some sequences can be much longer than others. Truncation ensures that these long sequences do not dominate the model’s memory usage or processing time.\n",
    "Focus on Relevant Information: By truncating sequences, you can focus the model’s attention on the most relevant or important parts of the sequence. For instance, in sentiment analysis, the beginning of a review might be more indicative of sentiment than its middle or end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Original sequence:\n",
    "\"Natural Language Processing is a fascinating field with many applications in modern technology, ranging from chatbots to machine translation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "After truncation (assuming max_len=10):\n",
    "\"Natural Language Processing is a fascinating field with many\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Balancing max_len, Padding, and Truncation\n",
    "Choosing the right max_len involves balancing the trade-offs between truncation and padding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Too Short max_len: If max_len is too short, many sequences will be truncated, leading to potential loss of important information. This can negatively impact model performance, especially if crucial context is lost.\n",
    "Too Long max_len: If max_len is too long, most sequences will require a lot of padding, leading to inefficiencies in model training. The model might waste resources processing padding tokens, which do not carry any meaningful information.\n"

    "The model consists of the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens into dense vector representations. (Docs: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Embedding.html)\n",
    "3. **Masking and Summing**: Masks padding tokens and sums the embeddings across the sequence.\n",
    "4. **Linear Layer**: Applies another linear transformation to the modified embeddings. (Docs: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html)\n",
    "5. **Classification Layer**: Outputs the class scores for each input sequence. (Docs: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dimension of input is always the batch size, and all the neural network layers are equipped to handle this scenario. So, for simple operations like forward passes from network layers, you will never need to handle batching explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, all models are extended from `nn.Module` because it serves as the base class for all neural network modules, providing essential functionalities that are crucial for building and training deep learning models. Here’s why extending from nn.Module is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parameter Management\n",
    "- `nn.Module` automatically registers all the layers (and their parameters) defined within the model. This allows PyTorch to easily access and manage these parameters for operations like training, saving, and loading the model.\n",
    "2. Forward Propagation\n",
    "- `nn.Module` defines the structure that allows you to override the forward method, which is where the forward pass of the network is defined. When you extend from nn.Module, you define how data flows through your model by implementing the forward method.\n",
    "3. Module Nesting\n",
    "- `nn.Module` allows for the creation of complex models by composing simpler sub-modules. When sub-modules (layers, blocks, etc.) are added as attributes of a custom nn.Module, they are automatically registered and their parameters are included in the parent module’s parameters.\n",
    "4. Utility Functions\n",
    "- `nn.Module` provides a variety of utility functions like .to() for moving the model to different devices (CPU/GPU), .eval() and .train() for setting the model’s mode, and methods for saving/loading model parameters.\n",
    "5. Training and Inference\n",
    "- By extending from `nn.Module`, your custom model can easily integrate with PyTorch’s training loop utilities like optimizers and loss functions. The backward pass and parameter updates are handled smoothly when using an nn.Module.\n",

    "1. **Reduce Learning Rate**: Lower learning rates help the model converge more slowly and avoid overfitting\n",

    "When evaluating a multi-class classification model, it's essential to understand a variety of metrics to get a comprehensive view of your model's performance. Below are some key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Confusion Matrix** is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. Each row of the matrix represents the instances of the true class, while each column represents the instances of the predicted class. In a multi-class classification scenario, the confusion matrix can provide detailed insight into how well the model is performing for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Positives (TP)**: The number of instances correctly predicted as belonging to a class.\n",
    "- **False Positives (FP)**: The number of instances incorrectly predicted as belonging to a class.\n",
    "- **True Negatives (TN)**: The number of instances correctly predicted as not belonging to a class.\n",
    "- **False Negatives (FN)**: The number of instances incorrectly predicted as not belonging to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix allows you to see not only the accuracy of the predictions but also where the model is getting confused between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** is a metric that tells us how many of the instances predicted as positive (or as a specific class in multi-class classification) are actually positive (or belong to that class). It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "High precision indicates that the model has a low false positive rate. In a multi-class context, precision is typically averaged across all classes to give a single precision score, often using the **weighted average** to account for class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall** (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) tells us how many of the actual positive instances (or a specific class) were correctly identified by the model. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "High recall indicates that the model has a low false negative rate. Like precision, recall can also be averaged across all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. F1 Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The **F1 Score** is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{F1 Score} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score is especially useful when you need to find a balance between precision and recall, and there is an uneven class distribution (one class might be more frequent than others).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** is the simplest and most commonly used metric, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances (both true positives and true negatives) out of the total number of instances:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\\text{Total Number of Predictions}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While accuracy gives a good general sense of the model’s performance, it might not be the best metric in cases of class imbalance. In such cases, precision, recall, and F1 score provide a more detailed view.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How These Metrics are Computed\n",
    "\n",
    "During model evaluation:\n",
    "- The **confusion matrix** provides a summary of the predictions made by the model compared to the actual labels.\n",
    "- **Precision** and **recall** focus on the performance of the model for each class, especially in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions.\n",
    "- The **F1 score** offers a balance between precision and recall, particularly useful when you want to ensure that both false positives and false negatives are minimized.\n",
    "- **Accuracy** gives an overall measure of how often the model's predictions are correct, but should be interpreted carefully in the presence of class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are essential for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your classification model, guiding you toward potential improvements or areas needing further tuning.\n",

    "1. Our preprocessing was very basic and we used word-tokenization. Typically, NLP systems use more complex preprocessing to clean the data, like removal of stop words, removal of less frequent words, stemming, etc., and use sub-word tokenization. They also handle punctuations differently.\n",
    "2. We used a very simple feedforward network. This is not very suited for complex NLP tasks, as they don't capture the semantic relationships well. Using RNNs/LSTMs/Transformers will yeild better results.\n",
    "3. Class imbalance - We can see that the first two classes have around 3500 more data instances than the third class (happiness). This also contributes to inaccuracies, as the training data doesn't represent that. There are ways to avoid this class imbalance problem like over/under sampling, generating synthetic data, etc."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provided a solid foundation for using PyTorch in NLP, covering the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and inference. While we used a simple feedforward network for demonstration, more advanced models like RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers would likely yield better performance for complex NLP tasks. The key takeaway is that PyTorch offers the flexibility and tools necessary to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models effectively, making it an excellent choice for NLP and other machine learning tasks.\n"
